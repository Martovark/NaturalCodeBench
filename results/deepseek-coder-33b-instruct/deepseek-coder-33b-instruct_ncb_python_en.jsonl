The generated code must be placed between the ```python and ```, and only one code block is allowed: \nAssume there is a file system that stores both files and directories. \nConsider 'dir' as the only directory in the root directory. 'dir' contains two subdirectories 'subdir1' and 'subdir2'. 'subdir1' contains a file 'file1.ext' and a subdirectory 'subsubdir1'; 'subdir2' contains a subdirectory 'subsubdir2', which contains the file 'file2.ext'.\nIn text format, it is shown as follows (⟶ represents a tab)\ndir\n⟶ subdir1\n⟶ ⟶ file1.ext\n⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1\n⟶ subdir2\n⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2\n⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext\nIf it is represented in code, the above file system can be written as \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\". '\\n' and '\\t' are newline and tab characters respectively.\nEach file and folder in the file system has a unique absolute path, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the location of the file/directory, all paths are connected with '/'. In the above example, the absolute path pointing to 'file2.ext' is \"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\". Each directory name is composed of letters, numbers and/or spaces, and each file name follows the format of 'name.extension', where 'name' and 'extension' are composed of letters, numbers and/or spaces.\nGiven a string 'input' representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to the file in the file system. If there are no files in the system, return 0.\nFor example:\n    Input: input = \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\"\n    Output: 32\n    Explanation: There are two files:\n    \"dir/subdir1/file1.ext\", path length 21\n    \"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\", path length 32\n    Return 32, because this is the longest path\nHints:\n    1 <= input.length <= 104\n    input may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a newline character '\\n', a tab character '\\t', a dot '.', a space ' ', and numbers.\n\nYou need to follow the function names or class names in the test cases.

If the name contains a dot, it means it's a file, so it updates the maximum length if necessary.
